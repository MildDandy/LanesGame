Game prototype WIP from 2017 that I never completed. 

July 31st / August 1st, 2017

Plants vs. Zombie / Wave Defense-esque game where you fought against various quadrilateral enemies. 
Was gonna have upgrades to your main triangle
Hardest part was getting your projectile's to be independent with the triangle ( if you shoot a bullet, it shouldn't be following the triangle's vertical position)
2016-2017 project, kinda wish I did more, but what can you do.
